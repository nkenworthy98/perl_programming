# 1. [7] Write a program that acts like cat, but reverses the order of the output lines.
# (Some systems have a utility like this named tac.) If you run yours as ./tac fred
# barney betty, the output should be all of file betty from last line to first, then
# barney, and then fred, also from last line to first. (Be sure to use the ./ in your
# program’s invocation if you call it tac so that you don’t get the system’s utility
# instead!)
#
# Call this program using:
# perl exercise_1.pl fred barney betty

print reverse (<<>>);
