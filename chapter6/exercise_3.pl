# 3. [15] Write a program to list all of the keys and values in %ENV. Print the results in
# two columns in ASCIIbetical order. For extra credit, arrange the output to verti‚Äê
# cally align both columns. The length function can help you figure out how wide
# to make the first column. Once you get the program running, try setting some
# new environment variables and ensuring that they show up in your output.

# is well over 100 characters and causes all kinds of formatting issues.
# If I didn't have this one variable with so many characters, I should
# be able to use $value_length without a problem.
